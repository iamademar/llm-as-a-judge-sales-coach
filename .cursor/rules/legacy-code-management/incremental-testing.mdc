# Title: Introduce Tests Incrementally Using Indirection Techniques

## When legacy classes lack tests but are undergoing changes...
- Recommend using techniques like Extract Method, Subclass Override, or Interface Injection.

## Suggestion:
"Consider extracting this logic or parameterizing the constructor to make it testable in isolation."

## Justification:
Incremental testing enables safer refactors and improves code coverage without requiring full rewrites.
