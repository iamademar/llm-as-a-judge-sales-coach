# Title: Wrap External Dependencies for Testability

## When accessing system resources, global state, or third-party APIs...
- Recommend wrapping those in classes or interfaces under your control.

## Suggestion:
"This external call could make testing difficult. Consider abstracting it behind an interface or wrapper."

## Justification:
Wrapping dependencies allows mocking/stubbing during tests and decouples logic from infrastructure.
