# Title: Refactor Incrementally, Avoid Full Rewrites

## When encountering large, untested legacy code...
- Discourage full rewrites.
- Encourage small, reversible changes with incremental testing.

## Suggestion:
"Instead of rewriting, refactor a small part and add tests as you go. Aim for continuous improvement."

## Justification:
Refactoring in place avoids regressions, preserves existing behavior, and retains undocumented business rules.
