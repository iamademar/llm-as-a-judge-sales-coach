# Title: Use Scratch Refactoring for Risk-Free Exploration

## When major refactoring is needed...
- Suggest cloning the code in a disposable context and testing refactor ideas safely.

## Suggestion:
"Try copying this code into a throwaway file or branch and freely refactor there before applying changes incrementally."

## Justification:
Scratch refactoring lets you explore improvements without risk and apply only the proven ones back into the production branch.
