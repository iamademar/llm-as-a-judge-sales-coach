# Title: Break Dependencies to Enable Unit Testing

## When tightly coupled or hard-to-test code is found...
- Suggest using refactorings like Extract Interface, Replace Inheritance with Delegation, or Break Out Method Object.

## Suggestion:
"This class is hard to isolate. Consider extracting interfaces or delegating to smaller components to improve testability."

## Justification:
Breaking dependencies enables modularity and safer testing for components in isolation.
