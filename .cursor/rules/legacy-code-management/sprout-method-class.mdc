# Title: Sprout Method or Class for New Behavior

## When new logic is introduced into legacy code...
- Recommend creating a new method or class instead of modifying the legacy code directly.

## Suggestion:
"Instead of inserting new behavior here, consider creating a new method or class and calling it from this location."

## Justification:
Sprouting reduces the risk of introducing bugs into fragile or untested legacy areas.
