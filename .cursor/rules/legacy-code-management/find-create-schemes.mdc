# Title: Use Seams to Isolate Behavior for Testing

## When direct dependencies or hardcoded logic are detected...
- Suggest using a seam (e.g., interface, config, or method override) to isolate behavior.

## Suggestion:
"This code uses a hard dependency. Consider creating a seam to inject alternatives or enable testability."

## Justification:
Seams help introduce test points and allow behavior to be altered without editing the legacy code directly.
