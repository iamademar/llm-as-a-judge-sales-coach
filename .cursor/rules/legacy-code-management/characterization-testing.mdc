# Title: Characterization Testing Before Modifications

## When modifying legacy code...
- Check if the method or class has existing tests.
- If not, recommend writing characterization tests to lock in current behavior.

## Suggestion:
"Consider writing a test that captures the current output of this method before modifying it."

## Justification:
Characterization tests protect against unintended behavior changes and document existing logic, especially when no tests exist.
